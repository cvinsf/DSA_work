 ** Given a stack, sort it using only stack operations (push and pop).
 ** You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements 
 ** into any other data structure (such as an array). 
 ** The values in the stack are to be sorted in descending order, 
 ** with the largest elements on top.
